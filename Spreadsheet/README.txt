10/20/21 : Added skeleton code + formatted the spreadsheet panel to fit the application window.
10/21/21 : Added function, prints cell name when selecting cell
10/21/21 : Added functionality that saves cell content to spreadsheet then gets the value
10/21/21 : Added functionality that changes other cell values (on grid) as cell contents change
10/22/21 : Added functionality to menu -> currently has open + new (open needs testing new currently works)
10/22/21 : Open function works, save function works, close functions fixed
10/22/21 : Made cell value show correct errors without needing to select new cell => when an exception is detected a message box shows the issue
10/22/21 : Added feature => dark mode/light mode to change the background color (may want to mess with spreadsheet panel to change those colors too)
//possible ideas for extra feature : dark mode, plot line of best fit/calculate line of best fit for a set fo data
